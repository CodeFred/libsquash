## Building

On most systems you could build and test the library using the following commands,

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ctest

## API

### `squash_new_disk(data, data_size)`

Creates a new `squash_disk_t` instance by reading from `data`, which is of length `data_size`.
`data` should point to a `const uint8_t` array holding the binary content of the SquashFS file,
which could be generated by an independently installed `mksquashfs` tool and loaded into the memory in advance.
The returned `squash_disk_t` instance should be later freed by calling `squash_destroy_disk`.

### `squash_destroy_disk(disk)`

Frees the memory allocated for `disk`.
Note that the original referenced SquashFS data when creating `disk` will not be freed.
