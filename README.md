    ctest --verbose

## API

### `squash_opendisk(error, data, data_size)`

Opens a SquashFS disk by reading the memory at `data` up to `data_size` bytes.
`data` should point to an array of bytes of a SquashFS file,
which could be generated by an independently installed [mksquashfs](http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/) tool and be loaded into memory in advance.
If successful, `squash_opendisk()` returns a pointer to the disk; 
otherwise `NULL` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.
The returned disk should later be closed by `squash_closedisk()`.

### `squash_closedisk(error, disk)`

Closes the named SquashFS `disk` and frees the structures associated with it.
Note that the original referenced array of bytes of a SquashFS file will not be freed.
Upon successful completion, a value of `0` is returned.
Otherwise, a value of `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_stat(error, disk, path, buf)`

Obtains information about the file pointed to by `path` of a SquashFS `disk`.
The `buf` argument is a pointer to a stat structure as defined by
`<sys/stat.h>` and into which information is placed concerning the file.
Upon successful completion a value of `0` is returned.
Otherwise, a value of `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_lstat(error, disk, path, buf)`

Acts like `squash_stat()` except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link;
`squash_lstat()` returns information about the link,
while `squash_stat()` returns information about the file the link references.

### `squash_fstat(error, disk, fildes, buf)`

Obtains the same information as `squash_stat()`
about an open file known by the Libsquash file descriptor `fildes`.

### `squash_open(error, disk, path)`

Opens the file name specified by `path` of a SquashFS `disk` for reading.
If successful, `squash_open()` returns a non-negative integer, termed a Libsquash file descriptor.
It returns `-1` on failure and sets `error` to the reason of the error.
The file pointer (used to mark the current position within the file) is set to the beginning of the file.
The returned resource should later be closed by `squash_close()`.

### `squash_close(error, fildes)`

Deletes a Libsquash file descriptor from the per-disk object reference table.
If this is the last reference to the underlying object, the object will be deactivated.
For example, on the last close of a file the current seek pointer associated with the file is lost.
Upon successful completion, a value of `0` is returned.
Otherwise, a value of `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_read(error, fildes, buf, nbyte)`

Attempts to read `nbyte` bytes of data from the object
referenced by the SquashFS file descriptor `fildes`
into the buffer pointed to by `buf`,
starting at a position given by the pointer associated with `fildes` (see `squash_lseek`),
which is then incremented by the number of bytes actually read upon return.
When successful it returns the number of bytes actually read and placed in the buffer;
upon reading end-of-file, zero is returned;
Otherwise, a value of `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_lseek(error, fildes, offset, whence)`

Repositions the offset of the SquashFS file descriptor `fildes`
to the argument `offset`, according to the directive `whence`
(if `whence` is `SQUASH_SEEK_SET` then the offset is set to `offset` bytes;
if `whence` is `SQUASH_SEEK_CUR`, the `offset` is set to its current location plus `offset` bytes;
if `whence` is `SQUASH_SEEK_END`, the `offset` is set to the size of the file plus `offset` bytes
and subsequent reads of the data return bytes of zeros).
The argument `fildes` must be an open Libsquash file descriptor.
Upon successful completion, it returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from the beginning of the
file.
Otherwise, a value of `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_readlink(error, path, buf, bufsize)`

Places the contents of the symbolic link `path` in the buffer
`buf`, which has size `bufsize`.
It does not append a NUL character to `buf`.
If it succeeds the call returns the count of characters placed in the buffer;
otherwise `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_scandir(error, dirname, namelist, select, compar)`

Reads the directory `dirname` and builds an array of pointers to directory entries using `malloc`.
If successful it returns the number of entries in the array; 
otherwise `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.
A pointer to the array of directory entries is stored in the location referenced by `namelist`
(even if the number of entries is `0`),
which should later be freed via `free()` by freeing each pointer in the array and then the array itself.
The `select` argument is a pointer to a user supplied subroutine which is called by `scandir`
to select which entries are to be included in the array. The `select` routine is passed a pointer to a directory entry
and should return a non-zero value if the directory entry is to be included in the array.
If `select` is `NULL`, then all the directory entries will be included.
The `compar` argument is a pointer to a user supplied subroutine which is passed to `qsort`
to sort the completed array. If this pointer is `NULL`, then the array is not sorted.


### `squash_opendir(error, disk, filename)`

Opens the directory named by `filename` of a SquashFS `disk`,
associates a directory stream with it and returns a pointer
to be used to identify the directory stream in subsequent operations.
The pointer `NULL` is returned if `filename` cannot be accessed,
or if it cannot allocate enough memory to hold the whole thing,
and sets `error` to the reason of the error.
The returned resource should later be closed by `squash_closedir()`.

### `squash_closedir(error, dirp)`

Closes the named directory stream and frees the structure associated with the `dirp` pointer,
returning `0` on success.
On failure, `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_readdir(error, dirp)`

Returns a pointer to the next directory entry.
It returns `NULL` upon reaching the end of the directory or on error. 
In the event of an error, `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_rewinddir(dirp)`

Resets the position of the named directory stream to the beginning of the directory.

### `squash_dirfd(error, dirp)`

Returns the integer Libsquash file descriptor associated with the named directory stream.
On failure, `-1` is returned and `error` is set to the reason of the error.

### `squash_telldir(dirp)`

Returns the current location associated with the named directory stream.

### `squash_seekdir(dirp, loc)`

Sets the position of the next `squash_readdir()` operation on the directory stream.
The new position reverts to the one associated with the directory stream
when the `squash_telldir()` operation was performed.

## Multithreading

Libsquash maintains no global states at the library level.
All states are confined within a SquashFS disk instance created by `squash_opendisk`.
However, no mutexes exist inside a SquashFS disk instance yet (Pull Requests are welcome).

Thus it is thread-safe when no SquashFS disk instances are shared among threads;
otherwise you need to add mutex to guard each shared SquashFS disk instances
to achieve thread-safety for the moment.
